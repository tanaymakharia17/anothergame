Nim and Vim are two brothers from different mothers they both are very friendly but 
when it comes to playing games! they fight like real brothers. They start plaing A game which requires both to pickup and remove tiles from a stack one by one. Given total of N tiles in a stack a Player can remove exactly 2 tiles or 3 tiles in each turn. Game ends if a player is not able to pickup tiles from the stack.
Neither Nim nor Vim likes to loose so they both choose number of Tiles in each turn optimally.
Given that Nim starts first, can you determine if Nim will win the game!
